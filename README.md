# Optimizing-Sales-and-Customer-Growth-Easy-Technologies-Data-Challenge-January-2026
Interactive dashboards turning sales and customer data into actionable insights for business growth and strategic decisions.

## Project Topic: Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard

### Project Overview  
I created an end-to-end sales and customer performance analysis using interactive dashboards to help stakeholders understand what is happening in the business, why it is happening, and what actions should be taken next.  

This project consists of two dashboards:  
1. Business Performance Dashboard - shows revenue, orders, products, regions, and sales trends.

2. Customer Performance Dashboard - shows customer value, behaviour, segmentation, and demographics.

My goal was to go beyond simple reporting metrics and deliver actionable insights for decision-making.  

### Business Questions I Answered  
- How is overall revenue performing year over year?
- Which regions, products, and categories are driving revenue?
- Who are our most valuable customers?
- Which customer segments should we prioritize for growth or retention?
- Where are the key opportunities and risks in the business?  

### Data Source  
Easy Technologies provided this dataset via their LinkedIn Profile. You can access the dataset for this project [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hW1r-VlsuO733q5ETOJPgw9pQkl2j3Zs/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=112141935801493290562&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### Tools & Techniques    
- Data Cleaning & Modeling - to prepare raw transactional data for analysis  
- Excel Power Pivot - for building a relational data model, handling large datasets, and creating advanced DAX calculations  
- RFM Analysis - to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value
- Powerpoint - to create the dashboard wireframe  
- Excel - for building interactive dashboards and visuals 

#### Power Pivot & Data Model  
1. Diagram View (Data Model)  
I built a data model showing relationships between tables to enable seamless analysis without flattening data.

2. Data View (Sample Tables)  

Sales Table Sample:

### Key Metrics I tracked  
- Total Revenue: $14.54M (+114% YoY)
- Total Orders: 5,000
- Total Quantity Sold: 28,651
- Average Order Value: $2,907
- Total Customers: 300
- Orders per Customer: 16.67
- Avearge Customer Value: $48,455  

### Key Insights I Discovered  

Business Performance  
- Revenue growth is driven by order volume, not price increases  
- The West region leads revenue despite not having the highest customer count  
- Sports and Home Appliances are the top-performing categories  
- A small set of high-demand products drives most of the revenue  

Customer Performance  
- Champions generate the majority of revenue ($9.7M)  
- Customers aged 26–35 and female customers contribute the highest revenue  
- The North region shows both low customer count and low revenue, indicating potential growth opportunities  


### Recommendations  
1. Customer Strategy  
- Retain Champions and Loyal Customers with personalized offers and loyalty programs
- Use high-value customer profiles to guide acquisition campaigns

2. Regional Strategy  
- Investigate and target campaigns in North region
- Replicate successful West-region strategies in other regions where applicable

3. Product Strategy  
- Increase visibility and bundling of high-demand products
- Review pricing or discontinue consistently low-demand products

4. Revenue Optimization  
- Focus on increasing Average Order Value through upselling and cross-selling


### Limitations  
This analysis is based on static historical data and does not include real-time updates, marketing activity, seasonality, or cost/margin information. Customer attributes are limited, which restrictsdeeper segmentation, and the analysis assumes the underlying data is accurate without advanced validation checks.  


### Conclusion  
In this project, i demonstrated how Excel, Excel Power Pivot, and DAX can be used to transform raw sales, products, and customer data into actionable business insights. The dashboards reveal that revenue growth is strong but concentrated in high-value customers, products, and regions highlighting clear opportunities for optimization.  

**Impact:**   
This analysis provides a clear foundation for improving customer retention, optimizing product focus, addressing regional underperformance, and shifting growth strategy from volume-driven to value-driven decisions.
