# Optimizing-Sales-and-Customer-Growth-Easy-Technologies-Data-Challenge-January-2026
Interactive dashboards turning sales and customer data into actionable insights for business growth and strategic decisions.

## Project Topic: Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard

### Project Overview  
I created an end-to-end sales and customer performance analysis using interactive dashboards to help stakeholders understand what is happening in the business, why it is happening, and what actions should be taken next.  

This project consists of two dashboards:  
1. Business Performance Dashboard - shows revenue, orders, products, regions, and sales trends.

2. Customer Performance Dashboard - shows customer value, behaviour, segmentation, and demographics.

My goal was to go beyond simple reporting metrics and deliver actionable insights for decision-making.  

### Business Questions I Answered  
- How is overall revenue performing year over year?
- Which regions, products, and categories are driving revenue?
- Who are our most valuable customers?
- Which customer segments should we prioritize for growth or retention?
- Where are the key opportunities and risks in the business?

#### Power Pivot & Data Model  
1. Diagram View (Data Model)  
I built a data model showing relationships between tables to enable seamless analysis without flattening data.

### Key Metrics I tracked  
- Total Revenue: $14.54M (+114% YoY)
- Total Orders: 5,000
- Total Quantity Sold: 28,651
- Average Order Value: $2,907
- Total Customers: 300
- Orders per Customer: 16.67

### Key Insights I Discovered  

Business Performance  
- Revenue growth is driven by order volume, not price increases  
- The West region leads revenue despite not having the highest customer count  
- Sports and Home Appliances are the top-performing categories  
- A small set of high-demand products drives most of the revenue  

Customer Performance  
- Champions generate the majority of revenue ($9.7M)  
- Customers aged 26–35 and female customers contribute the highest revenue  
- The North region shows both low customer count and low revenue, indicating potential growth opportunities  


### Actions I Recommend  
1. Customer Strategy  
- I recommend prioritizing retention of Champions and Loyal Customers through personalized offers and loyalty programs
- I would also use high-value customer profiles to guide acquisition campaigns

2. Regional Strategy  
- I suggest investigating the North region and testing targeted campaigns
- Replicate successful West-region strategies in other regions where applicable

3. Product Strategy  
- I would increase visibility and bundle high-demand products
- Review or discontinue low-performing products

4. Revenue Optimization  
- I recommend focusing on increasing Average Order Value through upselling and cross-selling
